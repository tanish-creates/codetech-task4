# Automated Report Generation

## Overview
This project demonstrates how to automatically generate a PDF report from data in a CSV file. The script reads the data, analyzes it using Python's Pandas library, and generates a formatted PDF report using the `FPDF` library. 

The generated report includes a summary of the dataset and detailed statistical analysis.

## Features
- **Data Reading**: The script reads data from a CSV file.
- **Data Analysis**: It performs basic data analysis using Pandas, providing statistical insights like mean, median, and standard deviation.
- **Report Generation**: The project generates a PDF report containing the analysis in a well-structured format.
- **Downloadable Report**: Once the report is generated, you can download the PDF file.

## Installation

To run this project, you need the following libraries:
- `fpdf` for generating PDF reports.
- `pandas` for data manipulation and analysis.

### Install Dependencies:
```bash
pip install fpdf pandas
